# ESG and Corporate Sustainability Guide

## What is ESG?

ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance—three central factors used to evaluate the sustainability and ethical impact of investments in companies. ESG criteria help investors identify companies with better risk management and long-term value creation potential.

## The Three Pillars of ESG

### Environmental (E)

Environmental criteria examine how a company performs as a steward of nature.

**Key Metrics:**
- Carbon emissions and carbon footprint (Scope 1, 2, 3)
- Energy consumption and efficiency
- Water usage and management
- Waste management and recycling rates
- Biodiversity impact
- Pollution prevention
- Climate change mitigation efforts
- Renewable energy adoption

**Common Standards:**
- GHG Protocol for emissions accounting
- Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)
- CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project)
- TCFD recommendations

### Social (S)

Social criteria evaluate how a company manages relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, and communities.

**Key Areas:**
- Labor practices and working conditions
- Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)
- Employee health and safety
- Human rights policies
- Supply chain management
- Community engagement
- Customer satisfaction
- Data privacy and security

**Metrics Examples:**
- Gender pay gap
- Employee turnover rate
- Workplace injury rates
- Community investment
- Customer satisfaction scores

### Governance (G)

Governance deals with company leadership, executive pay, audits, internal controls, and shareholder rights.

**Key Elements:**
- Board composition and diversity
- Executive compensation
- Business ethics
- Anti-corruption policies
- Shareholder rights
- Transparency and disclosure
- Risk management
- Regulatory compliance

## ESG Reporting Frameworks

### Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)
- Most widely used sustainability reporting standard
- Comprehensive stakeholder-focused approach
- Sector-specific guidelines available
- Emphasis on materiality

### Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)
- Industry-specific standards
- Focused on financially material issues
- 77 industry standards
- Investor-oriented

### Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
- Climate-specific framework
- Four core elements: Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, Metrics
- Scenario analysis recommended
- Increasingly mandatory

### International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB)
- New global baseline for sustainability disclosure
- Consolidates existing frameworks
- IFRS S1 and S2 standards
- Focus on enterprise value

## Carbon Footprint Calculation

### Scope 1: Direct Emissions
- Emissions from owned or controlled sources
- Company vehicles, on-site fuel combustion
- Process emissions from manufacturing

### Scope 2: Indirect Emissions from Purchased Energy
- Electricity, steam, heating, cooling
- Location-based vs market-based methods
- Power purchase agreements (PPAs)

### Scope 3: Value Chain Emissions
- Upstream: purchased goods, transportation, waste
- Downstream: product use, end-of-life treatment
- Typically 70-90% of total footprint

### Calculation Methods
- Activity data × Emission factor = CO2e
- Use of recognized emission factors (DEFRA, EPA, IEA)
- Third-party verification recommended

## Setting Science-Based Targets

### What Are Science-Based Targets?
Emissions reduction targets aligned with climate science and Paris Agreement goals.

### SBTi Requirements:
- Cover Scope 1 and 2 emissions
- Include Scope 3 if >40% of total
- Align with 1.5°C or well-below 2°C pathway
- 5-15 year timeframe
- Annual reporting on progress

### Net-Zero Commitments
- Long-term target (2050 or sooner)
- Requires deep decarbonization (90%+)
- Limited use of offsets
- Near-term targets required

## ESG Integration in Investment

### Screening Approaches
- **Negative screening**: Excluding certain sectors
- **Positive screening**: Selecting best performers
- **Norms-based screening**: UN Global Compact, etc.

### ESG Integration
- Systematic inclusion in investment analysis
- Risk-adjusted returns consideration
- Engagement with companies

### Impact Investing
- Intentional positive outcomes
- Measurable social/environmental impact
- Financial returns with purpose

## Benefits of ESG

### For Companies
- Access to capital (ESG-linked financing)
- Lower cost of capital
- Operational efficiencies
- Risk mitigation
- Talent attraction and retention
- Brand value enhancement

### For Investors
- Better risk-adjusted returns
- Long-term value creation
- Alignment with values
- Regulatory compliance
- Fiduciary duty fulfillment

## ESG Data and Ratings

### Major Rating Providers
- MSCI ESG Ratings
- Sustainalytics
- S&P Global ESG Scores
- CDP Scores
- ISS ESG

### Challenges
- Lack of standardization
- Rating divergence
- Data quality issues
- Greenwashing concerns

## Future Trends

### Regulatory Developments
- EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)
- SEC climate disclosure rules
- ISSB adoption globally
- Mandatory climate reporting

### Technology Enablers
- AI for ESG data analysis
- Satellite monitoring
- Blockchain for supply chain
- Digital reporting platforms

## Conclusion

ESG is rapidly moving from a niche consideration to mainstream business practice. Companies that proactively address ESG factors are better positioned for long-term success, while investors increasingly recognize ESG as essential to risk management and value creation.
