    "instruction": "What is climate change?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. While climate change can occur naturally, human activities have been the main driver since the 1800s, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, which produces heat-trapping greenhouse gases."
  },
  {
