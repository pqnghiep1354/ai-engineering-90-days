    "input": "",
    "output": "Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. While climate change can occur naturally, human activities have been the main driver since the 1800s, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, which produces heat-trapping greenhouse gases."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Explain the greenhouse effect.",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The greenhouse effect is a natural process where certain gases in Earth's atmosphere trap heat from the sun, keeping the planet warm enough to sustain life. These gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, act like a blanket around Earth. However, human activities have increased greenhouse gas concentrations, enhancing this effect and causing global warming."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What are the main greenhouse gases?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The main greenhouse gases are: 1) Carbon dioxide (CO2) - from burning fossil fuels and deforestation; 2) Methane (CH4) - from agriculture, landfills, and natural gas; 3) Nitrous oxide (N2O) - from fertilizers and industrial processes; 4) Fluorinated gases - from industrial applications; 5) Water vapor - the most abundant but varies naturally."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How does renewable energy help combat climate change?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Renewable energy helps combat climate change by replacing fossil fuel-based electricity generation with clean sources that produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions. Solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal power can provide electricity without burning carbon-based fuels. Transitioning to renewables is essential for reducing global emissions and meeting climate targets."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is carbon neutrality?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Carbon neutrality, also called net-zero carbon emissions, means achieving a balance between the carbon emissions produced and the carbon removed from the atmosphere. This can be achieved by reducing emissions as much as possible and then offsetting remaining emissions through carbon sequestration, reforestation, or carbon capture technologies."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Explain ESG investing.",
    "input": "",
    "output": "ESG investing integrates Environmental, Social, and Governance factors into investment decisions. Environmental criteria examine how a company impacts nature, including carbon emissions and resource use. Social criteria look at relationships with employees, suppliers, and communities. Governance involves leadership, audits, and shareholder rights. ESG investing aims to generate long-term returns while promoting sustainable practices."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is the Paris Agreement?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change adopted in 2015 by 196 parties. Its goal is to limit global warming to well below 2°C, preferably 1.5°C, compared to pre-industrial levels. Countries submit Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) outlining their climate actions and must report regularly on emissions and implementation efforts."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What are the impacts of sea level rise?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Sea level rise caused by climate change has significant impacts: 1) Coastal flooding and erosion threatening communities; 2) Saltwater intrusion contaminating freshwater supplies; 3) Loss of coastal ecosystems like wetlands and mangroves; 4) Displacement of millions of people in low-lying areas; 5) Damage to coastal infrastructure and property; 6) Increased storm surge damage during hurricanes."

  {
    "instruction": "Biến đổi khí hậu là gì?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Biến đổi khí hậu là sự thay đổi lâu dài của nhiệt độ và các kiểu thời tiết toàn cầu. Mặc dù biến đổi khí hậu có thể xảy ra tự nhiên, nhưng các hoạt động của con người là nguyên nhân chính kể từ những năm 1800, chủ yếu do đốt nhiên liệu hóa thạch như than, dầu và khí đốt, tạo ra khí nhà kính giữ nhiệt."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Năng lượng tái tạo là gì?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Năng lượng tái tạo là năng lượng được tạo ra từ các nguồn tự nhiên có thể tái tạo, bao gồm năng lượng mặt trời, gió, thủy điện, địa nhiệt và sinh khối. Khác với nhiên liệu hóa thạch, các nguồn năng lượng này không cạn kiệt và tạo ra ít hoặc không có khí thải nhà kính, giúp giảm thiểu biến đổi khí hậu."
